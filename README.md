You can find everything you need to set okokCrafting up in the config file.
You should add the item images inside the icons folder "okokCrafting/web/icons".
The images name should be EXACTLY the same that is in your server's database.
The images format MUST BE ".png", otherwise they won't show up.

[IMPORTANT]
The 'tableID' field on the config file is used to create the craft buttons, so make sure you ALWAYS set a different ID for each table.
